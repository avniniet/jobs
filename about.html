                    <h4>Our Goals</h4>

                    <p>At HR Forte, we visualize to bring organizational growth through talent, and at the same time,
                        help job seekers top the career ladder by becoming their launchpad. We want to set a benchmark
                        in the recruitment industry that businesses can look after when they need HR and workforce
                        solutions.</p>

                    <p>HR Forte’s purpose is to reshape the recruitment landscape that should include three of our key
                        stakeholders: organizations, candidates, and the community we call home. We want to help
                        businesses find the right fit, candidates the right role, and stakeholders the right support.</p>

                    <h4>COVID-19 and HR Landscape Across the Nation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a drastic toll on almost every industry, and recruitment is no
                        exception. Lockdowns imposed in the wake of the pandemic have not only resulted in the loss of
                        millions of jobs but, at the same, also triggered scarcity of jobs across the globe, as companies
                        put a halt to recruitment. According to a report, India faced an 18% decline in hiring activity in
                        April post lockdown, crippling the recruitment industry. But as the nation recovers from 
                        COVID-19, HR Forte aims to work day in and out to support companies and the Indian
                        Economy.</p>
